## 🚀 About This Project

This is a **personal learning tracker** I built to gamify my data science and AI education journey. Instead of just checking off courses in a spreadsheet, I wanted something more engaging and visually appealing.

### Why I Built This

- 📚 **Track my DataCamp progress** across 55+ skill tracks
- 🎮 **Gamify my learning** with cultivation-themed progression
- 🌐 **Share my journey** with a public-facing portfolio piece
- 💻 **Practice full-stack development** with React and Supabase
- 🎨 **Learn modern web technologies** while building something useful

## 📖 How It Works

### Public View
- Anyone can visit my site and see my learning progress
- Browse through the 7 cultivation phases
- Click on phases to expand and see skill tracks
- View completed courses (marked with ✓)
- See my overall progress percentage

### Admin Mode (Me Only)
1. Click the **"Admin Login"** button
2. Enter my admin password
3. Click any course to toggle completion status
